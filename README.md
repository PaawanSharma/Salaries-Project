[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)# Salaries prediction project in Python## The problemTwo tables of jobs are given, with each row corresponding to a different joband columns corresponding to various features of those jobs. For the trainingset, salaries are also given for each job. The task is to construct a modelthat can predict the salaries for the test set.## Directory structure* README.md -- this report.* code/Salaries prediciton.ipynb -- the main script of code, solving the problem from start to finish.* code/ -- also contains other code scripts used by the main notebook.    * code/eda/ -- scripts used for exploratory data analysis.         * code/eda/plot.py -- functions used for creating plots in EDA.         * code/eda/stats.py -- code used for statistical analysis in EDA.    * code/feature_engineering/encoders.py -- code used for encoding categorical variables.    * code/exceptions.py -- contains an exception used by encoding functions.    * code/model_selection.py -- code used for cross-validation of algorithms.    * code/preprocessing.py -- code used for preparing datasets for machine learning.* data/ -- the data used in this problem.    * data/train_features.csv -- the jobs of the training set.    * data/train_salaries.csv -- the true salaries for the training set jobs.    * data/test_features.csv -- the jobs of the test set.* cross_val_logs/ -- logs recording cross-validations that were performed.    * cross_val_logs/train_data_cross_val.csv -- cross-validation log for the training data.    * ecross_val_logs/ngineered_train_data_cross_val.csv -- cross-validation log for the training data after feature engineering had been performed on it.* results/ -- the best model found. This directory will contain unqiuesubdirectories for each model deployed.    * results/_model\_subdirectory_/model.joblib -- the saved model which can be loaded into a Python script using the joblib module.    * results/_model\_subdirectory_/feature_importances.csv -- feature importances for the saved model.    * results/_model\_subdirectory_/predictions.csv -- the model's predictions for the test set salaries.* .gitignore -- files to be ignored by git.
